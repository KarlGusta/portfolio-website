# portfolio-website
 
Hello ðŸ‘‹ . Thank you for taking your time to view my repo where I am creating my portfolio website. 

If it is a repo that you would also like to use, feel free to fork it.

I'm using:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Vercel. This is where the project is hosted.

If you would like to get to me, [hit me up on twitter](https://twitter.com/annoh_karlgusta)
